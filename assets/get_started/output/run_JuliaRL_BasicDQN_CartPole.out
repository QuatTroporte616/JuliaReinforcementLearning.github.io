This experiment uses three dense layers to approximate the Q value.
The testing environment is CartPoleEnv.

Agent and statistic info will be saved to: `/home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_20200620113750`
You can also view the tensorboard logs with `tensorboard --logdir /home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_20200620113750/tb_log`
To load the agent and statistic info:
```
agent = RLCore.load("/home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_20200620113750", Agent)
BSON.@load joinpath("/home/runner/work/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/JuliaReinforcementLearning.github.io/checkpoints/JuliaRL_BasicDQN_CartPole_20200620113750", "stats.bson") total_reward_per_episode time_per_step
